# Canadian Auto Vendor Project

## About the Project

Created a website that would be used by a manufacturing company. The company in this project is called Canadian Auto Vendor (not a real company). The website was created to utilize my skills of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The website is also responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
